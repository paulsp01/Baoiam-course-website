            We are mostly dog people (but we love cat people, too).

            Hubstaffers generally spend their free time cooking, playing games,
            reading, working out, brewing beer, or hanging with the family.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-4'>
            We're big into family. One of the great benefits of remote work is
            being home for bus pickup and drop-off.

            Wellness is important to us. Many Hubstaffers lift weights, rock
            climb, and practice yoga â€” as reported in our #wellness Slack
            channel.
